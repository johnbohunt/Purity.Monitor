Liquid Argon Purity Monitor Documentation 
The purity monitor works by shining a flshlamp on a gold plated cathode which lets off electrons that we then drift up through the 
liquid argon and are then detected by an anode at the top of the detector. We're able to measure the purity by comparing the charge at the 
cathode to the charge at the anode. The electrons are moved through an em field generated by a high voltage field cage.
